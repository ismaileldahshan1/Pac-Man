# Pac-Man
Pac-Man game in c++, using graphs data structure.


Overview

Welcome to the Pac-Man project implemented in C++ using the Qt framework. This project brings together classic Pac-Man gameplay with advanced features such as ghost movement using Dijkstra's algorithm and graph data structures.

Features

Classic Pac-Man gameplay with a user-friendly Qt GUI.
Ghost movement using Dijkstra's algorithm for intelligent and dynamic pursuit of the player.
Graph data structures for efficient representation of the game map and ghost movement logic.
Modular design allowing for easy extension and customization.


Prerequisites
C++ compiler compatible with the C++17 standard.
Qt framework installed on your system (version 6.x or later).

Building and Running
Download the zip file from github.
Run the .pro on QT.
Change the paths of each of the files that were implemented in the program.
Run the game.

Gameplay

Control Pac-Man using arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right).
Ghosts use Dijkstra's algorithm for dynamic pursuit.
Eat all the dots to advance to the next level while avoiding ghosts.
The game ends if Pac-Man is caught by a ghost.

Contribution

Contributions are welcome! If you find any bugs or have ideas for improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

Acknowledgments

Inspiration: The project is inspired by the classic Pac-Man game and the use of Dijkstra's algorithm for ghost movement.
Enjoy playing Pac-Man with intelligent ghost movement!
